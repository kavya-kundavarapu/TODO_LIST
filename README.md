📝 TODO List Application

A simple and interactive TODO List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks dynamically using DOM manipulation.

📌 Features

➕ Add new tasks

✏️ Edit existing tasks

🗑️ Delete tasks

🚫 Prevents empty task submission

🎨 Clean and responsive UI using Bootstrap

⚡ Instant updates without page reload

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure of the application

CSS3 & Bootstrap – Styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6) – Logic, event handling, DOM manipulation

📂 Project Structure
TODO_LIST/
│── index.html # Main HTML file
│── index.js # JavaScript logic
│── style.css # Custom styles (optional)
│── README.md # Project documentation

⚙️ How the Application Works

User enters a task in the input field.

On clicking Add Task, JavaScript dynamically creates a list item.

Each task has:

Edit button → update task text

Delete button → remove task from list

All actions happen on the client side using DOM manipulation.
